# In-Memory-File-System

## Transactional File System

A Python implementation of an in-memory file system with ACI transaction support (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation). This system provides multi-user concurrent access with configurable isolation levels but does not implement durability; all data is lost when the process terminates.

## Key Features

- **Transactional Operations**: Full rollback support with atomicity guarantees
- **Multiple Isolation Levels**: READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, and SNAPSHOT isolation
- **Concurrent Access Control**: Shared/exclusive locking (with some deadlock prevention)
- **Version Management**: Efficient diff-based storage for file changes
- **Interactive Console**: Command-line interface for testing and demonstration

## Core Components

- **FileSystem**: Main interface providing standard file/directory operations (touch, mkdir, rm, mv, etc.)
- **Transaction**: Manages transactional file operations with configurable isolation levels
- **TransactionManager**: Tracks transaction lifecycle (ACTIVE â†’ COMMITTED/ABORTED/ROLLED_BACK)
- **VersionFileObject**: Handles file versioning using space-efficient diff operations
- **FileLockManager**: Coordinates shared/exclusive file locks 
- **Console**: Interactive command-line interface for system interaction

## Transaction Properties (ACI)

- **Atomicity**: All changes in a transaction succeed or all are rolled back
- **Consistency**: Transactions maintain system invariants and file integrity
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Changes are lost when the process terminates (in-memory only)

## Usage Examples

### Console (run main.py)

#### Transaction Example

```bash
# Start a transaction and modify a file
/> touch data.txt
/> open data.txt
Opened: data.txt
/> txn_start
Transaction started: txn-123
/> write data.txt Hello World --txn txn-123
Content written
/> read data.txt --txn txn-123
Hello World
/> read data.txt
(empty file)
/> txn_commit txn-123
Transaction committed: txn-123
/> read data.txt
Hello World
